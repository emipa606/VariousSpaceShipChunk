    <content>It is now possible to add smaller debris to the Space Ship Chunk-event. This feature should add some more variety to the event. These smaller chunks have less material but are of the same kind as the bigger ones.
There is also a new type of chunk, a black variety that leaves some uranium when deconstructed.
